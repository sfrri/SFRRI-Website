<p class="statement primary_colour"><strong>Registration</strong></p>
<ol class="statement"><li><strong>When do I need to pay my registration fee?</strong><br /><br />
Your registration fee must be paid as part of the registration process. You will be asked to pay online by credit/debit card.</li>
  <li><strong>What is included in the conference registration fee?</strong><br /><br />
    For a full list of what is included in the registration fee please see the Registration Information section on the conference website. This will tell you whether any meals are provided as part of your fee and what materials and documentation you should expect to receive.</li>
  <li><strong>When should I register?</strong><br /><br />
    Please register as soon as you know that your attendance is definite. This will mean that the Conference Project Lead will be able to send all the relevant documentation to you in good time before the conference and your name will be included in the published list of participants. It will also mean that you have a guaranteed place - on occasions conferences do become fully booked and regrettably we do have to turn people away. However, if your attendance is not definite - i.e. you do not yet have your funding or entry visa finalized, please do not register yet. </li>
  <li><strong>When is the deadline for registration?</strong><br /><br />
    If you are planning to attend the conference as a standard delegate (i.e. not a presenter), there is no deadline for registration. As long as space is available at the conference, you can register right up until the conference itself. Do check the homepage of the conference website for announcements about the conference being/becoming fully booked. However, if you know you are going to attend, we do recommend that you do it as early as possible. As well as ensuring your place, this will mean that the Conference Project Lead will be able to send all the relevant documentation to you in good time before the conference and your name will be added to the published list of participants. If you are making a presentation at the conference, it is essential that you register according to the author registration deadline which is detailed in your acceptance correspondence. If you do not register by this date, your material will be automatically excluded from the final conference program.</li>
  <li><strong>It is very near to the conference, can I still pre-register?</strong><br /><br />
    If the conference is fully booked, this will be announced prominently on the homepage of the conference website. If there is no such announcement, we still have places available at the current time and you can therefore still register online.</li><li><strong>I am unable to pre-register - I can only register on the day. Is this possible?</strong><br /><br />
On occasions, conferences do become fully booked, and therefore in order to avoid a wasted journey to the conference, please check the homepage of the conference website for announcements. If places are still available you will be able to register on-site. Please note that we do require full payment for on-site registrations, and that we will be unable to invoice your organization at such a late stage.</li>
    <li><strong>I am not yet sure if I can definitely attend the conference. Is it okay for me to register now and then cancel later, or just not turn up at the conference?</strong><br /><br />
      No, if you are not sure that you can attend; do not register at this stage. Cancellation terms and conditions apply to your registration from the moment that you submit your registration to us, as we will then be holding a place at the conference specifically for you. The conference organisers incur prepaid costs for each place booked, for example for your conference catering and for conference materials, regardless of whether you ultimately attend or not, which is the reason for the cancellation charge. In addition if you book a place, and the conference becomes fully booked, you will be preventing someone else from attending the conference. Please refer to the Registration Information section of the conference website for the specific cancellation terms. Depending on when you cancel your place, you will be asked to pay 10%, 50% or 100% of the registration fee due. 100% cancellation charges apply if you book a place but do not attend the conference.</li>

<p class="statement primary_colour"><strong>Invoices/Receipts:</strong><a name="inv" id="inv"></a></p>
<ol class="statement"><li><strong>Will I automatically get a receipt for my registration fee?</strong><br /><br />
When you have registered and paid online you will be sent confirmation of your booking. You can then log back into the system to access your receipt, under the ‘My Invoices’ section.</li><li><strong>Will I get a receipt when I arrive at the conference?</strong><br /><br />
No, not automatically. You can access this directly by logging back into the online registration system. If you require any further receipt documents, please contact our accounts department before or after the conference. (Delegates are reminded not to email credit card information in any circumstances.)</li><li><strong>I have registered but I notice that my invoice is not for the correct amount. What should I do?</strong><br /><br />
Please contact the Conference Project Lead immediately, informing them of the error, so that it can be rectified straight away.</li>
<li><strong>I have to cancel my place at the conference. Can a colleague attend in my place?</strong><br /><br />
  This is usually not a problem. Please inform the Conference Project Lead in writing of your details, plus the contact details of the person who will be attending in your place. A substitution can then be made, and no extra charge or cancellation penalty is incurred.</li>
        <li><strong>I have to cancel my place at the conference completely and no one else from my organisation can attend in my place. What do I need to do?</strong><br /><br />
Please contact the Conference Project Lead in writing in order to cancel the place fully. Cancellation terms will apply and the cancellation charge will depend on the date of your cancellation - please refer to the Registration Information section of the website for details.</li>
        <li><strong>I need to cancel my place. Do you need to know the reason for my cancellation?</strong><br /><br />
Not necessarily. Unfortunately, the cancellation terms outlined in the Registration Information section of the website apply regardless of the reason for your cancellation. </li>
        <li><strong>I need to cancel, but it is too late to get any sort of refund of my fee. Is it okay for me to just not turn up at the conference?</strong><br /><br />
We would prefer that you inform the Conference Project Lead in writing of your cancellation for our records, regardless of whether you are due a refund or not.</li>
        <li><strong>I registered to attend the conference, but now I can't attend. I haven't paid yet, and I have not received confirmation anyway, so is it okay if I just don't turn up?</strong><br /><br />
No, if you are unable to attend, you must let the Conference Project Lead know in writing. Cancellation terms and conditions apply to your registration from the moment that you submit your registration to us, as we will then be holding a place at the conference specifically for you. This is regardless of whether you have received your confirmation documents and is regardless of whether you have paid or not. If you have not received your confirmation documents, please let us know. Please refer to the Registration Information section of the conference website for the specific cancellation terms. Depending on when you cancel your place, you will be asked to pay 10%, 50% or 100% of the registration fee due. 100% cancellation charges apply if you book a place but do not show up at the conference. This also applies if you have not yet pre-paid but you cancel or do not attend (you will still be asked to pay the applicable cancellation charge).</li>

<p class="statement primary_colour"><strong>Payment/VAT</strong><a name="pay" id="pay"></a></p>
<ol class="statement"><li><strong>How do I pay my registration fee?</strong><br /><br />
In order to expedite the registration process, please complete the registration with your credit card details. Your registration documents will be available on the system for you to download.</li>
  <li><strong>I notice that there is VAT to pay on the registration fee (for conferences taking place within the EU) but my institute is VAT-exempt. Does this mean that I can pay the fee without the VAT?</strong><br /><br />
    Unfortunately, no, you still have to pay the VAT. Your institute may be exempt from paying VAT on goods purchased, but conferences are classified as a service supplied where performed, and therefore the VAT of the country hosting the conference must be charged. For further details please consult the current VAT Act - Articles 9 and 15 - The Sixth VAT Directive - sect.77/388 which defines the place of supply of services.</li>

<p class="statement primary_colour"><strong>Abstracts</strong><a name="abs" id="abs"></a></p>
<ol class="statement"><li><strong>Can I submit an abstract now?</strong><br /><br />
Information will be available on the submit abstract (within the programme section) of the conference website. This will provide you with the relevant abstract submission deadline and submission guidelines, and it will also inform you if the submission period is not yet open, or if the deadline has passed and submissions are no longer being considered.</li><li><strong>How do I submit an abstract?</strong><br /><br />
Abstract submissions must be done online using the abstract submission system. Please see the submit abstract section of the conference website for full guidelines. The system involves you filling in a simple web form with your contact and abstract details, attaching your prepared abstract and pressing submit. The whole submission process is very quick, and means that your abstract is automatically acknowledged and is added to the review system. You must format your abstract exactly according to the template and guidelines provided on the website. Please do ensure that you submit carefully and accurately, in order to avoid later revisions. In order that you receive your automatic receipt, it is particularly important that you input your email address accurately.</li><li><strong>I am unable to attend the conference. Can I still submit my abstract for publication in the conference programme booklet/ CD?</strong><br /><br />
If you know for definite that it will be impossible for your material to be presented at the conference by yourself or a co-author/colleague if it is accepted, please do not make a submission. Only those abstracts to be presented at the conference by a registered delegate will be included in the conference program and abstract CD. We do not allow abstracts to be published in the conference materials without an attending author.</li><li><strong> I have submitted my abstract but have not received confirmation of receipt, what should I do?</strong><br /><br />
Most importantly, do not resubmit your abstract at this stage! There may be a number of reasons why you have not received your receipt. There may be an email delay, there may have been an error in your email address field on the form, or your organisation may have blocked the message assuming that it is spam. You should generally receive your receipt quoting your reference number within two hours of submission, but please wait one day before contacting the Publishing Content Coordinator. If you still do not have your receipt, please do contact the Publishing Content Coordinator in order to check the status of your submission. Important: Your submission is not valid until you receive the electronic receipt quoting your reference number! Please don't presume that we have received your abstract successfully until you have received acknowledgement of its safe receipt. </li><li><strong>I have submitted my abstract and have received a receipt, but now I realise that it contained a mistake and I need to revise it. Should I submit the abstract again online?</strong><br /><br />
    No, please do not resubmit your abstract online, as this will result in a duplication. Please send an email to the Publishing Content Coordinator explaining the revision, and attach the revised abstract. Remember to quote your abstract reference number.</li>

<li><strong>I have lost my abstract reference number - what should I quote when I contact the Conference Secretariat with a query?</strong><br /><br />
The Publishing Content Coordinator will be able to remind you of your abstract reference number, which should be quoted in future correspondence. In the meantime, please provide the Publishing Content Coordinator with the corresponding author's full name and the full abstract title(s) related to your query, in order for us to be able to trace your submission.</li><li><strong>I have submitted my abstract for review and have received an electronic receipt. What happens now?</strong><br /><br />
Your abstract will be sent for review by the Conference Scientific Review committee, in order to determine whether it is acceptable for presentation at the conference. This can take some time, and the date when we expect to be able to inform you of the outcome of review will be included in your electronic abstract receipt. Correspondence informing you of the outcome of review will be sent to you by email. This correspondence will inform you of the details of your presentation format, registration information as well as instructions for the submission of your full paper.</li><li><strong>My abstract has been accepted for presentation. Do I have to register by a particular deadline ?</strong><br /><br />
Yes, if you are presenting an oral or poster presentation, it is absolutely essential that you register by the author registration deadline which will be detailed in your acceptance correspondence. The acceptance of your abstract is conditional on you registering to attend the conference. Your registration confirms to the conference organisers that you will be presenting your material at the conference, and without your registration we will presume that you are no longer able to present. If you do not register by the author deadline, your presentation will be automatically removed from the program. If the deadline is problematic for you for whatever reason, then please contact the Publishing Content Coordinator in order to explain your situation, and in order that we can retain your material in the program.</li><li><strong>My abstract has been accepted, but I now need to withdraw it. How do I do this?</strong><br /><br />
Please let the Publishing Content Coordinator know as soon as possible by email, in order that we can update your records and the conference program.</li><li><strong>My abstract has been accepted, but we won't be able to present it at the conference. Can it still be included in the conference program booklet/ abstract CD?</strong><br /><br />
Unfortunately, no. Only those abstracts to be presented at the conference by a registered delegate will be included in the conference program booklet and abstract CD. We do not allow abstracts to be printed in the conference materials unless a presenting author registers to attend the conference.</li>
<li><strong>I submitted an abstract, but now I am unable to attend and present it at the conference. Can a co-author colleague present it on my behalf?</strong><br />
  <br />
  Subject to restrictions being in place regarding presenters giving multiple presentations, it should be acceptable for your co-author or colleague to present your material for you. However, it is essential that you inform the Publishing Content Coordinator of the name of the new presenting author before the author registration deadline, as your failure to register by the deadline will mean that your material is removed from the program.</li>

<p class="statement primary_colour"><strong>Presenter/Author</strong>
  <a name="pre" id="pre"></a>
<ol class="statement"><li><strong>I choose to make an oral presentation, but you inform me that I have been accepted as a poster, are you sure you are not making a mistake?</strong><br /><br />
Due to overwhelmingly large contributions of high standard we received this time and the limited slots for oral presentation, the committee had to make difficult decisions that unfortunately lots of interesting abstracts will be in posters. We believe we have selected an excellent mix of abstracts to address the conference themes</li><li><strong>As a presenter, why is there a deadline for me to register, when non-presenting delegates can register at any time?</strong><br /><br />
The author registration deadline is set so that we can ensure that the final printed oral and poster programs, program booklet and abstract CD are as up-to-date as possible and include only the presentations which are actually going to be presented at the conference itself. This avoids having disruptive empty oral slots and empty poster boards at the conference set aside for authors who submitted abstracts but were ultimately unable to present.</li>
<li><strong>I am going to present more than one presentation at the conference, do I need to pay more than one registration fee?</strong><br /><br />
  No, the registration fee for the conference applies to each attending delegate regardless of the number of presentations made.</li>
<li><strong>What size should I make my poster?</strong><br /><br />
  Full guidelines for the production of your poster are available on the conference website. Please contact the Publishing Content Coordinator should you need a further copy of the guidelines.</li>
<li><strong>When is my oral presentation and how long should it last?</strong><br /><br />
  Please refer to the conference oral program to see when your individual presentation will take place and its duration.</li>
<li><strong>The details of my presentation have changed, but the old details are still on the website. When will it be updated?</strong><br /><br />
  Please inform the Publishing Content Coordinator if your presentation details need to be updated on the website. Please bear in mind that the website is updated periodically, but is not immediately reflective of each change to the program as it occurs.</li>

<p class="primary_colour statement "><strong>Deadlines</strong><a name="dea" id="dea"></a></p>
<ol class="statement">
<li><strong>I realise that I need to register by the author registration deadline, but I am still waiting to hear whether I have funding to attend. What should I do?</strong><br /><br />
Do not register for the conference, until you are sure that your funding to attend the conference is approved. Cancellation terms and conditions apply to your registration from the moment that you submit your registration to us, as we will then be holding a place at the conference specifically for you. The conference organisers incur prepaid costs for each place booked, for example for your conference catering and for conference materials, regardless of whether you ultimately attend or not, which is the reason for the cancellation charge. In addition if you book a place, and the conference becomes fully booked, you will be preventing someone else from attending the conference. Rather than registering, and potentially cancelling at a later stage, please let the Publishing Content Coordinator know your position, and let us know the date when you expect to receive confirmation of the funding application.</li>
<li><strong>I realise that I need to register by the author registration deadline, but I am still waiting to hear whether I have been successful with my entry visa application. What should I do?</strong><br /><br />
  Do not register for the conference, until you are sure that your entry visa has been approved. Cancellation terms and conditions apply to your registration from the moment that you submit your signed registration form to us, as we will then be holding a place at the conference specifically for you. The conference organisers incur prepaid costs for each place booked, for example for your conference catering and for conference materials, regardless of whether you ultimately attend or not, which is the reason for the cancellation charge. In addition, if you book a place, and the conference becomes fully booked, you will be preventing someone else from attending the conference. Rather than registering, and potentially cancelling at a later stage, please let the Publishing Content Coordinator know your position, and let us know the date when you expect to receive notification regarding your visa application from the relevant authorities.</li>
<li><strong>I want to make sure that I am kept fully informed about this conference, and sent all relevant information about it. What should I do?</strong><br /><br />
  In order that we can keep you fully informed, please complete the reply form on the conference website. This will mean that we will be able to send to you information, such as the conference program and registration brochure when it becomes available. On the reply form, you can also request email updates, which is a good way for you to get the most up-to-date information. Due to data protection restrictions, we are unable to send you conference information unless you specifically request it using the reply form.</li>
<li><strong>Are there any group travel arrangements for the conference, official air carriers or official travel agents?</strong><br /><br />
No, we have found from experience that delegates prefer to make their own independent travel arrangements. In the age of internet bookings, it is easier and more cost-efficient for you to shop around and find the most convenient travel option for yourself. The conference organisers do not provide shuttles from the airport to the conference venue, but transfers by public transport are normally available and information on these can be found on the information sheet which can be found within the registration system, upon completing your registration.</li>

<p class="statement primary_colour"><strong>VISA</strong><a name="vis" id="vis"></a></p>
<ol class="statement">
<li><strong>Do I need a visa to attend the conference, and if so, can the Conference Department help me with my entry visa application?</strong><br /><br />
If you are unsure whether you need a visa to attend the conference, please check with your local embassy or travel agent. If you do, it is essential that you begin the process as soon as possible, in order that you obtain your visa in time for the conference or registration deadline. Visa application procedures for entering many countries and in particular the USA, have become stricter and more complex following recent terrorist activities, and therefore it can take much longer to process your application than anticipated. Subject to certain conditions, we can provide a standard invitation letter to assist you with your visa application and this should be downloaded from the registration system. We do ask though that you submit your own application to the relevant authority and follow up accordingly. Unfortunately the Project Lead is unable to follow up your application on your behalf or enter into correspondence directly with consulates. </li>
<li><strong>Can you send me an invitation letter ASAP? I need this to apply for a visa.</strong><br /><br />
  Please note that you can download the invitation letter under your account in the registration system.  Please note if this must have your abstract title, then please contact customer service for further help. </li>

<li><strong>How do I book accommodation for the conference?</strong><br /><br />
  An official accommodation option is always included on the conference website once the registration period is open. Please see the Location section of the conference website for details of how to make a booking. Please note that you should book early to guarantee availability and any special conference rate.</li>

<p class="statement primary_colour"><strong>Conference/General questions</strong><a name="gq" id="gq"></a></p>
<ol class="statement">
<li><strong>Is there a specific dress code for the conference sessions or for any of the other conference events?</strong><br /><br />
  There is no specific dress code for the conference sessions. However, if you are attending a conference in a hot climate, please remember that the conference room will be air-conditioned. We recommend that you bring along a sweater or jacket for indoors. Similarly, unless a dress code is given on the website along with the details for any conference dinners or social events, then you are free to dress as you like.</li>
<li><strong>Is there a dress code if I am doing an oral presentation</strong><br /><br />
  Not a dress "code" as such, but we would just recommend that for your presentation you wear something with either a lapel or a buttoned front in order that the wireless lapel microphone can be clipped on properly. Also, it is important that oral presenters do not wear a neck-scarf or anything which may interfere with the lapel microphone.
</li>
<li><Strong>I am unable to come to the registration session at the start of the conference. Can I register at a later stage?</Strong><br /><br />Yes, the conference information and registration desk will be staffed throughout conference hours for queries and late registration.
</li>
<li><strong>I didn't book any optional extras (such as workshops/optional dinners) when I made my original registration, but I want to add them on now. How do I do this?</strong><br /><br />
Please log back into the system and you can add additional products to your order
</li>
<li><strong>I do not have any funding and cannot pay to attend the conference, can the Committee waive my registration fee/give me discount/subsidize my expenses?</strong><br /><br />
Unfortunately the conference organizers do not have funds available to support delegate attendance. We wish you every success in your independent search for funding.
Please note that authors that do not register by the author registration deadline will have their presentation removed from the programme.

<li><strong>What materials will I get when I arrive at the conference?</strong><br /><br />
  As a minimum, you will receive the final printed program and conference abstracts plus a list of participants.
