USA and MSc (1974) and PhD in Physiology (1978) from University College London. He was appointed to a 4-year postdoctoral Research Fellowship at Queen Elizabeth College, London and a Lectureship in Physiology (1981), Readership (1992) and then as Professor of Vascular Physiology at King's College London in 1997. He is currently General Secretary of the Society of Free Radical Research-International and previously served as President of the Society for Free Radical Research-Europe, Chairman/Vice Chairman of The Physiological Society, President of the European Pancreatic Society, President of the European Microcirculation Society, President of the British Microcirculation.<br />Prof Mann is the Reviews Editor for Free Radical Biology & Medicine and the Chair of the Ethics Committee for Free Radical Biology & Medicine. He serves on Editorial Boards of The Journal of Physiology, Microcirculation and as an Editorial Advisor for the Biochemical Journal. He is currently a member of Heart Research UK Translational Science Panel, Board of External Referees for the Biotechnology & Biological Sciences Research Council and College of Experts for the Medical Research Council - Physiological Systems & Clinical Sciences and was previously Chair of the Translational Sciences Panel for Heart Research UK, Medical Panel of the Henry Smith Charity and a member of grant panels of the British Heart Foundation, Guy's & St. Thomas’ Hospital Charitable Foundation and Royal Society International Networks Panel. He has published >160 research papers and coordinated >36 research symposia at international conferences, including a recent Plenary Symposium entitled ‘Oxygen Matters in Redox Biology’ at joint meeting of the Society for Redox Biology (SfRBM) and Society for Free Radical Research International (SFRRI) in San Francisco, 16-20 November 2016.<br />Prof Mann’s Vascular Biology research group at King’s College London is investigating signalling cascades involved the transcriptional activation of antioxidant defence genes in endothelial and smooth muscle cells in oxidative stress. His research group are interested in vascular dysfunction induced by oxidative stress in diseases such as atherosclerosis, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and stroke, and the health benefits of dietary inducers of the redox sensitive transcription factor Nrf2 involved the upregulation of endogenous antioxidant defences. More recently, his group are focusing on the importance of adapting human endothelial and smooth muscle cells long-term to ‘physiological’ oxygen concentrations to investigate Nrf2 and nitric oxide signalling in response to inflammatory mediators and/or laminar shear stress.</p>

<p align="justify"><br /><br />Victor Darley-Usmar received his Ph.D. at the University of Essex in England and then moved to the University of Oregon as a Post-Doctoral Fellow to pursue his interests in the structure and function of mitochondrial proteins in human disease.After a period as a lecturer in Japan and ten years as a Research Scientist in Burroughs Wellcome in London he joined UAB to establish his own research group in the Department of Pathology in 1995.  He has received multiple awards for training and mentoring and served as the Associate Dean for Post-Doctoral Education and the Pathology Graduate Program Director. <br />He established the UAB Center for Free Radical Biology from 2006-2015 as an international center for research in redox biology. In his current role of Associate Dean for Research he brings his experience in the commercial sector and career development programs to the strategic management of the School of Medicine Research. In his own research program he has been instrumental in defining how redox biology modifies mitochondrial function in pathology and in recognition of these achievements was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Society for Free Radical Biology and Medicine in 2012. At UAB his contribution to research in mitochondrial pathology was recognized by his appointment as the Foundation Faculty for the “Endowed Professorship in Mitochondrial Medicine and Pathology”.  He is now developing a program to apply measures of bioenergetic health to personalized medicine. <br />He was a recent recipient of the prestigious “Creativity is a Decision” and “Blue Sky” awards from UAB for the Bioenergetic Health Index concept. He has been continuously funded by NIH for 22 years and has published over 300 articles with an H factor of 94. </p>

<p align="justify">Francisco R. M. Laurindo graduated in Medicine by the University of São Paulo School of Medicine, São Paulo, Brazil , in 1978 and completed his residence training in Internal Medicine and Cardiology at the Heart Institute(Incor), University of São Paulo School of Medicine. After a period (1982-84) as associate physician at the same institution, he underwent research training in Physiology and Pharmacology at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, in Bethesda, Maryland (under Dr. Robert Goldstein, 1984-87). Back to the Heart Institute, University of São Paulo School of Medicine, he started an investigative research track focused on mechanisms of redox signaling processes in the vascular system. He obtained his PhD in 1992, supervised by Dr. Protásio da Luz. Thereafter, he conducted several research projects through independent financial support from research agencies. In 2001, he started, together with Dr. Protásio da Luz, the Vascular Biology Laboratory at the Heart Institute (Incor), University of São Paulo School of Medicine and became its Director in 2008, until presently. His major research interests have focused on understanding mechanisms and regulatory processes underlying the production of oxidant species in vascular cells and tissues and their physiological implications for vessel remodeling in disease. The most important contributions of his group have been the original description of shear stress-dependent generation of superoxide radical from the endothelium, the multi-level characterization of redox response to vascular injury and, particularly, the original discovery that the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein disulfide isomerase interacts functionally and physically with oxidant-generating NADPH oxidase complexes. This finding had relevant implications regarding the role of endoplasmic reticulum (patho)physiology on NADPH oxidase function and how redox processes regulate cell migration and vascular remodeling. More recently, Dr. Laurindo's group showed an important role for extracellular PDI in arterial remodeling after injury. Dr. Laurindo has authored or co-authored over 140 publications in peer-reviewed journals, cited >3400 times (h-index=33(ISI)). He supervised 18 PhD students and 17 post-doctoral fellows, in addition to several undergraduate trainees. From 2008-14, he was the vice-coordinator of the <em>National Institute for Science and Technology of Redox Processes in Biomedicine (CNPq/Fapesp)</em> and since 2013 (until present) the Vice-coordinator and principal investigator of <em>Cepid-Fapesp</em> <em>Redoxoma</em>.

During a post-doctoral fellowship in Munich and Düsseldorf together with Helmut Sies she investigated the cellular thiol-disulfide status in perfused organs under various conditions of oxidative stress. The detection and analysis of mixed disulfides of proteins and glutathione provided a basis for the regulation of enzyme activities by thiol modification, a now expanding field. From 1984-1991 she was heading a Molecular Biology Lab in the pharmaceutical industry in Aachen. Apart from constructing high expression vectors for the production of a recombinant human plasminogen activator in E. coli she was supervising PhD students with whom she sequenced the gene for GPx4. 1992-2013 she was tenure professor at the University of Potsdam and heading the Department 'Biochemistry of Micronutrients' at the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbrücke (DIfE). Her favourized micronutrients at the DIfE were vitamin E and selenium from both of which the physiological function is not yet sufficiently characterized. Her group was the first to elucidate the metabolism of tocopherols and tocotrienols. Regarding selenium, her major interests are related to redox-regulated processes in inflammation and cancer development influenced by selenium and specific selenoproteins, mainly GPx2 and 4.<br />She serves on the editorial boards of several journals in the field of nutrition, micronutrients, free radicals, and redox regulation and was President of <em>SFRR-Europe</em> 2005/2006.

She has pioneered methodologies for evaluating vitamin E status in humans using stable isotopes and identified key mechanisms for the regulation of vitamin E bioavailability in humans. Her top cited review articles include those concerning vitamin E metabolism and its antioxidant function. Her laboratory has identified that complete vitamin E depletion in embryonic zebrafish caused by the knock-down of the alpha-tocopherol transfer protein prevents normal brain formation and causes death by 15-24 h. Moreover, severe vitamin E deficiency results in depletion of specific phospholipids containing docosahexaenoic acid and a derangement in lysophospholipids, suggesting dysregulation of membrane repair. Further, these embryos undergo a lethal dysregulation of energy metabolism (e.g. anti-Warburg effect), switching from high to low oxygen consumption with a concomitant depletion of glutathione. This embryonic model shows how vitamin E prevents lipid peroxidation and prevents cell lethality.<br />She has published over 275 peer-reviewed articles and invited papers/book chapters.

<p align="justify">Ohara Augusto received her undergraduate (B. S. in Chemistry in 1972) and graduate (Ph. D. in Biochemistry in 1975) titles at the Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo and did postdoctoral work at the University of California Berkeley (1980), and University of California San Francisco (1981-1982), CA, USA. Her research interests have always been focused in the understanding of the multiple roles of free radicals and oxidants in physiology and pathophysiology. Among her contributions to the redox biology filed, it can be mentioned the establishment that carbon-centered radicals can alkylate biomolecules and that the carbonate radical and nitrogen dioxide are relevant bioradicals. While studying production of the carbonate radical by human superoxide dismutase 1 (hSOD1) she showed that attack of the radical on the enzyme produced a novel cross-link, the ditryptophan cross-link. Since then, she has been studying the formation of the ditryptophan cross-link in proteins other than hSOD1 and by oxidants other the carbonate radical. She is also investigating the potential role of this cross-link in protein aggregation diseases. Additionally, she has been interested in the mechanisms of protein thiol oxidation and nitrosation. While working in the redox area, she supervised many students that concluded MS dissertions and PhD Thesis, some of which are already well-recognized scientists, Her prizes include the 2002 Medal for Biology and Medicine of the International EPR Society and the Brazilian Order of Scientific Merit. She is Member of Brazilian Academy of Science, of The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) and of Academia de Ciências do Estado de São Paulo. She is also Fellow of the Society for Redox Biology and Medicine. Since 2013 she is an Associated Editor of the journal Free Radical Biology and Medicine and Director of the Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center for Redox Processes in Biomedicine.</p>

After a postdoctoral fellowship with Irwin Fridovich at Duke University, he has held faculty positions at the University of Pennsylvania (Physiology), University of Southern California (Pediatrics, Pathology & Molecular Toxicology) and the University of Alabama, where he was the Chairman of Environmental Health Sciences. He was a Founding Faculty member of the University of California campus at Merced where he participated in establishing both science and general education programs as well as helped start their doctoral programs. In 2015, he returned full-time to the University of Southern California. Dr. Forman is Past President of the Society for Redox Biology and Medicine and is now Editor-in-Chief of Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics. Previously, he served as Treasurer of the Society for Free Radical Research International and as the Reviews Editor for Free Radical Biology & Medicine. Dr. Forman has mentored over thirty Ph.D. and postdoctoral trainees. Dr. Forman’s research is in oxidative stress and signal transduction. He did pioneering work in mitochondrial superoxide production in which he demonstrated that manganese superoxide dismutase actually pulls the reaction forward, redox signaling in which he first demonstrated signaling by endogenously generated hydrogen peroxide, and mechanisms of induced resistance to oxidative stress in which he demonstrated the induction of glutathione biosynthesis by quinones.  His current research focuses on the decline in antioxidant protection in aging that increases susceptibility to inflammation through altered Nrf2 and NF-kB signaling and on oxidative stress in sickle cell disease. He has published over 200 peer-reviewed articles, over 50 book chapters, edited three science books, and authored two mystery novels. In 2016, he presented the Society for Free Radical Research – Europe Award Lecture and was honored with the Society for Redox Biology and Medicine Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>
