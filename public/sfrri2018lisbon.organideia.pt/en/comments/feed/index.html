		<description><![CDATA[In a previous work, we reported that PONs activities (PON1 paraoxonase and arylesterase, PON2 methyl paraoxonase, and PON3 simvastatinase) were significantly higher in the follicular fluid of large follicles compared with small ones, suggesting that the enzymes have a role in follicle maturation. The findings were found in follicles from both fertile and subfertile women (Meijide et al Reprod Biomed Online 2017). PON1 activities were associated with the number of total oocytes retrieved. Moreover, the activity of PON3 was higher in follicles from fertile women than from patients, suggesting the involvement of the enzyme in fertility. 
We also characterized the activities and protein expression of the extracellular PON1 and PON3 proteins in serum and follicular fluid samples obtained from the same woman. The results on PONs expression suggested that the activities determined in follicular fluid did not simply reflect an increased HDL diffusion from the blood through the blood-follicle barrier, but the local synthesis from ovarian cells (Meijide et al Reprod Biomed Online 2017).
The present study confirms the expression of the three enzymes in human granulosa cells, thus being in agreement with our previous results.]]></description>
