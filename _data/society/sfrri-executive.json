She has co-organized international conferences on redox biology as part of the Oxygen Club of California, and on polyphenols (International Conference on Polyphenols and Health). In 2004, Prof Otezia was a member of the organizing committee of the SFFRI biennial meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Vice-President of the Free Radical-South America Group Congress in Buenos Aires in 2013. Dr. Oteiza's research program is focused on the basic mechanisms underlying interactions between nutrition and environmental toxicants in human health, in particular during early development and chronic inflammatory disorders. She studies the mechanisms of nutrients/bioactives and toxicants, mainly those involving redox-sensitive signals and that are relevant for neurodevelopment. She has also conducted extensive work on the capacity of plant bioactives, mainly flavonoids, to mitigate obesity- and inflammation-associated pathologies through redox-regulated mechanisms. She is currently studying how flavonoids can modulate inflammation- and oxidative-mediated impairment of events occurring in the gastrointestinal tract that can impact overall health, including insulin resistance, steatosis and brain inflammation.",

I have received extensive training and have broad background in biomedical research.\n\nAfter receiving medical training at Beijing University School of Medicine and obtaining a PhD degree studying nuclear proteins, I was trained with Dr. Carol Greider, the co-winner of 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine, focusing on the regulation of telomerase in developmental biology. Together with Dr. Horowitz, we were the first to describe the involvement of programmed cell death in the pathogenesis of acute inflammatory lung injury.\n\nMy lab is the first to show that airway HMGB1 not only mediates inflammatory responses, it can also directly compromise macrophage functions in clearing invading bacteria, contributing to bacterial pneumonia observed in patients with CF and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Our studies on the effects of oxidative stress on macrophage functions of innate immunity have a strong impact on the management of patients on ventilators. In summary, I have a strong record of accomplished projects in an area highly relevant to this proposed project. I have supported SFRBM and SFRRI throughout my career and have served on the SFRBM Executive and SFRBM Outreach Committee.",

After a 4-year postdoctoral Research Fellowship at Queen Elizabeth College London, he was appointed to a Lectureship in Physiology (1981), Readership in Physiology (1992) and then as Professor of Vascular Physiology at King's College London in 1997.\n\nHe previously served as President-Elect and Secretary General of SFRR-International and as President of the SFRR-Europe, Chairman/Vice Chairman of The Physiological Society, President of the European Pancreatic Society, President of the European Microcirculation Society, President of the British Microcirculation Society and as a Council Member of the Physiological Society, Society for Free Radical Research-Europe, European Society for Microcirculation and Member of International Liaison Committee for Microcirculation.\n\nGiovanni Mann is Reviews and Special Issues Editor for Free Radical Biology & Medicine and the Chair of the Ethics Committee for Free Radical Biology & Medicine. He is an Associate Editor for Physiological Reviews and on the Editorial Board of Redox Biology. He has served on Editorial Boards of The Journal of Physiology, Microcirculation and an Editorial Advisor for the Biochemical Journal. He serves on the Board of External Referees for the Biotechnology & Biological Sciences Research Council and College of Experts for the Medical Research Council - Physiological Systems & Clinical Sciences and was previously Chair of Heart Research UK Translational Sciences panel and served on The Royal Society International Networks Panel. He has published >180 research papers (h-index 59) and coordinated >45 research symposia at international conferences, including a Plenary Symposia focused on 'Oxygen Matters in Redox Biology' at the joint meeting of the Society for Redox Biology (SFRBM) and Society for Free Radical Research International (SFRRI) in San Francisco 2016 and at the SFRRI Meeting in Lisbon, Portugal 2018.\n\nHis Vascular Biology research group at King's College London is investigating signalling cascades involved the transcriptional activation of antioxidant defence genes in endothelial and smooth muscle cells in oxidative stress. We are interested in vascular dysfunction induced by oxidative stress in diseases such as gestational diabetes and stroke, and the health benefits of dietary inducers of the redox sensitive transcription factor Nrf2 involved the upregulation of endogenous antioxidant defences. More recently, his group have focused on the importance of adapting human cultured vascular and other cell types long-term to 'physiological' oxygen levels to investigate Nrf2 and nitric oxide signalling in response to inflammatory mediators and/or laminar shear stress.",
