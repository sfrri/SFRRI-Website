Dr. Oteiza's research program is focused on the basic mechanisms underlying interactions between nutrition and environmental toxicants in human health, in particular during early development and chronic inflammatory disorders. She studies the mechanisms of nutrients/bioactives and toxicants, mainly those involving redox-sensitive signals and that are relevant for neurodevelopment. She has also conducted extensive work on the capacity of plant bioactives, mainly flavonoids, to mitigate obesity- and inflammation-associated pathologies through redox-regulated mechanisms. She is currently studying how flavonoids can modulate inflammation- and oxidative-mediated impairment of events occurring in the gastrointestinal tract that can impact overall health, including insulin resistance, steatosis and brain inflammation.",

Together with Dr. Horowitz, we were the first to describe the involvement of programmed cell death in the pathogenesis of acute inflammatory lung injury.\n\n\n\nMy lab is the first to show that airway HMGB1 not only mediates inflammatory responses, it can also directly compromise macrophage functions in clearing invading bacteria, contributing to bacterial pneumonia observed in patients with CF and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Our studies on the effects of oxidative stress on macrophage functions of innate immunity have a strong impact on the management of patients on ventilators. In summary, I have a strong record of accomplished projects in an area highly relevant to this proposed project.
