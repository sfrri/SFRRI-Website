                <h2>Women in Science Forum</h2>
                <p>SFRRI WIS was established as a SFRRI sub-committee in 2018 with strong support from the
                    SFRRI Executive Committee. At the SFRRI Biennial Meeting (hosted by SFRR-Europe) in Lisbon,
                    Portugal in 2018, SFRRI WIS and SFRR-Europe WIS and Society for Redox Biology and Medicine
                    WIS organized the first international WIS Forum, attended by more than 50 female and male scientists.
                    At the SFRRI WIS Forum in Lisbon, Lin Mantell, Marie-Carmen Gomez Cabrera and Maria
                    Paola Nitti chaired a Round Table discussion with Chang Chen, Ting-Ting Huang, Elizabeth Ledgerwood
                    and Patricia Oteiza. In 2021, WIS from all regional SFRR Societies were invited and
                    agreed to join the SFRRI WIS Forum.</p>
                <p>The Women in Science (WIS) Forum of SFRRI is an evolving and dynamic sub-committee that seeks
                    to support and enhance the careers, scientific achievements and leadership roles of women in the
                    field of redox biology and medicine.</p>
                <h4>Our objectives are to:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Expand the participation, visibility, and leadership roles of female scientists in all Society
                        functions and activities</li>
                    <li>Invite female scientists to present their research at the Annual Conferences</li>
                    <li>Provide training workshops on essential career skills</li>
                    <li>Promote leadership development and opportunities for junior scientists</li>
                    <li>Encourage the use of collaborative models that maximize openness, inclusiveness, and mutual
                        success.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Leadership and Development:</h4>
                <p>One of the goals of WIS is to develop strategies to promote women in leadership roles in the scientific
                    community, both within SFRRI as well as in their careers. We are exploring ways for women within
                    SFRRI to network with those who have obtained leadership roles as officers, editors and participating
                    in plenary sessions at SFRRI Biennial Meetings. We also promote and encourage the nomination of
                    highly successful female scientists for distinguished awards given by the SFRRI.</p>
                <h4>Website:</h4>
                <p>In addition to leadership development, WIS maintains the Women in Science (WIS) webpage on
                    the SFRRI website. The purpose of the webpage is to increase awareness of the WIS Forum and
                    thereby increase participation of female scientists in the SFRRI WIS Forum. Please contact Prof.
                    Lin Mantell for further information and to share WIS event in your regional SFRR Societies.</p>
